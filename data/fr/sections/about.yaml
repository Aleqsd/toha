# a summary about you
summary: "I've been working for the past two years, first as a teacher at my university and then as a free lance content writer and translator for several companies and associations.\n
I am a passionate writer and languages in the broder sense of the term fascinate me. I am detail oriented and my number one focus is to adapt my skills to specific needs.\n
I love being challenged, exploring new territories, and watching people grow around me.\n\n
Writing, translating, learning ... We can talk about it, let me help!"
